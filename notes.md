need to know js and react

framework for building native apps using JS

apps are native -
- don't need to know iOS or Android programming
- can write app code in JS
- companies prefer this

Can use Expo or the React Native CLI

Expo hides a lot of complexity from us
- if never done mobile dev before, expo is the way to go

Creating a project with expo means no iOS or Android subprojects

no working with native features of project

first need to install expo cli

install the expo app

using vscode
